```

```

3.4

a. N(µ = 4313, σ = 583), N(µ = 5261, σ = 807)

b. The z-scores tell me that Leo is 1.09 sd's from the mean, and Mary is .31 sd's from the mean.
```{r}
leo_z <- (4948 - 4313) / 583; leo_z
mary_z <- (5513 - 5261) / 807; mary_z
```

c. Mary ranked better than Leo. Both are positive, which means they are above the mean time, but Mary's z-score is lower than Leo's, meaning she is closer to the mean.

d. The percentage is the (1 - pnorm).
```{r}
leo_per <- pnorm(leo_z); 1 - leo_per
```

e. The percentage is the (1 - pnorm).
```{r}
mary_per <- pnorm(mary_z); 1 - mary_per
```

f. Z-scores would still be able to be calculated, but d and e would not be possible without a normal plot.

3.18

a. 68% of score fall within 1σ, 96% within 2σ, and 100% within 3σ. 
```{r}
range_68 <- c((61.52 - 4.58), (61.52 + 4.58)); range_68
per_68 <- (21 - 4) / 25; per_68
range_95 <- c((61.52 - 4.58 * 2), (61.52 + 4.58 * 2)); range_95
per_95 <- 24 / 25; per_95
range_997 <- c((61.52 - 4.58 * 3), (61.52 + 4.58 * 3)); range_997 
```

b. The distribution is unimodal and symmetrical, with the curve looking normal. The normal probability plot follows a relatively straight line, with 2 outliers, neither of which are extreme.

3.22

a.
